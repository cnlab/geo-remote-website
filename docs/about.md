title: About the GeoSmoking Study
---

## Background

Cigarette smoking accounts for **1 in 5 deaths** annually in the U.S. While tobacco retail exposure is linked to adverse smoking outcomes, naturalistic studies remain sparse. 

Our study combines:
- üì± Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
- üó∫Ô∏è Geolocation tracking
- üß† Neuroimaging (fMRI)

## Objectives

1. **Within-person associations** between real-world tobacco retail exposure and:
   - Cigarette craving
   - Smoking behavior
2. **Causal effects** of retail exposure
3. **Neural mechanisms** via cue reactivity

## Methods

### Baseline (2 weeks)
- Daily EMA reports
- Geolocation tracking
- Tobacco retailer database (PA, NJ, DE)

### Intervention (4 weeks)
Randomized to:
1. Non-tobacco retail visits (daily)
2. Tobacco retail visits (daily) 
3. Control (normal routine)

### Optional
- fMRI session at UPenn

## Results

| Metric          | Count |
|-----------------|-------|
| Enrolled        | 310   |
| Completed baseline | 282 |
| Completed intervention | 244 |
| fMRI scans      | 24    |

**Timeline**: May 2022 - June 2024

## Conclusions
This innovative protocol may inform:
- Health behavior interventions
- Tobacco control policies
- Neural models of addiction
