## Background

Cigarette smoking accounts for **1 in 5 deaths** annually in the U.S. Exposure to tobacco retail has been linked to adverse smoking outcomes, but research utilizing naturalistic and causal approaches to quantify these effects in the real world remains relatively sparse. To address this, we used ecological momentary assessment, geolocation tracking, and neuroimaging to assess smoking outcomes in the real world, and conducted a randomized controlled trial focused on the effects of exposure to tobacco retail.

## Objectives

1. Examine within-person associations between real-world tobacco retail exposure and cigarette craving/smoking
2. Establish causal effects of real-world tobacco retail exposure through a randomized controlled trial
3. Investigate neural cue reactivity as a mechanism for real-world tobacco retail effects

## Methods

We enrolled 310 participants in this multi-phase study:

- Geolocation tracking  
**Intervention protocol:**  
- Randomized to 1 of 3 tobacco retail exposure conditions  
- Regular purchases at stores that sell tobacco (tobacco retailer condition), or at stores that do not sell tobacco (non-tobacco retailer condition); or following normal routine (control condition)
