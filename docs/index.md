## Background

Cigarette smoking accounts for **1 in 5 deaths** annually in the U.S. While tobacco retail exposure is linked to adverse smoking outcomes, naturalistic studies examining these effects remain relatively sparse. Our study combines ecological momentary assessment, geolocation tracking, and neuroimaging to investigate these relationships in real-world contexts.

## Objectives

1. Examine within-person associations between real-world tobacco retail exposure and cigarette craving/smoking
2. Establish causal effects of tobacco retail exposure through a randomized controlled trial
3. Investigate neural cue reactivity as a mechanism for real-world tobacco retail effects
