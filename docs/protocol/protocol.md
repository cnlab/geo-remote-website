<div class="highlight-box"> <p><strong>The GeoSmoking Study</strong> investigates the causal effects of exposure to tobacco retail environments on smoking behavior and neural reactivity among daily cigarette smokers.</p> </div>
Study Setting and Design
<div class="method-card"> <h3>üèõÔ∏è Study Overview</h3> <p>The GeoSmoking Study was conducted at the University of Pennsylvania. Adults who smoked cigarettes daily were recruited across PA, DE, and NJ to complete a multi-part, remote study.</p> </div>
The study consisted of three main components:

<div class="research-timeline"> <div class="timeline-item"> <span class="timeline-marker">Phase 1</span> <h4>Baseline Period</h4> <p><strong>2 weeks</strong> - EMA reporting, geolocation tracking, tobacco retail exposure assessment</p> </div> <div class="timeline-item"> <span class="timeline-marker">Phase 2</span> <h4>Intervention Period</h4> <p><strong>4 weeks</strong> - Randomized store visits, continued EMA and geolocation tracking</p> </div> <div class="timeline-item"> <span class="timeline-marker">Phase 3</span> <h4>fMRI Session</h4> <p><strong>Optional</strong> - On-campus neural reactivity assessment</p> </div> </div>
During the two-week baseline period, participants reported craving and smoking via EMA multiple times per day while their geolocation was tracked to calculate tobacco retail exposure. The following four-week intervention period was designed to assess causal effects of exposure to tobacco retail.

Participants were randomly assigned to enter a tobacco retail store or a non-tobacco retail store once per day, or to follow their normal routines, while EMA and geolocation continued to be collected. Following the intervention period, eligible participants could opt into a fMRI session conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, designed to investigate neural reactivity to tobacco marketing cues.

Eligibility Criteria
Baseline Phase
<div class="side-by-side"> <div> <h4>‚úÖ Inclusion Criteria</h4> <ul> <li>Ages 21-65 years</li> <li>Smoke ‚â•5 cigarettes daily for past 6 months</li> <li>Own iPhone or Android smartphone for daily use</li> <li>Residents of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or Delaware</li> <li>Able to read and speak English fluently</li> <li>Fully vaccinated against COVID-19</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h4>‚ùå Exclusion Criteria</h4> <ul> <li>Concurrent enrollment in smoking cessation programs</li> <li>Plans to use nicotine substitutes within 3 months</li> <li>Urine cotinine concentration below 200 ng/mL</li> <li>Pregnancy</li> <li>Refusal to install required mobile applications</li> <li>Phone functionality inadequate for study tasks</li> <li>Inability to upload Google Timeline data</li> <li>Planned extended trips outside PA, NJ, DE during study</li> </ul> </div> </div>
Intervention Phase
<div class="method-card"> <h4>üìä Participation Requirements</h4> <p>Participants needed to respond to <strong>‚â•75% of EMA prompts</strong> during the baseline period to continue to the intervention phase.</p> </div>
Beginning on October 6, 2023, participants were asked at completion of the baseline period if they would still be able to complete store visits. This was asked before participants knew their assigned condition. If the participant indicated that they were no longer able to complete the store visits, they were excluded from further participation.

<div class="highlight-box"> <p><strong>Study Protocol Evolution:</strong> From study start until October 13, 2022, participants were excluded during the intervention period for non-compliance. On October 13, 2022, the study team moved to an intent-to-treat approach and did not exclude participants due to non-compliance once they began the intervention period.</p> </div>
