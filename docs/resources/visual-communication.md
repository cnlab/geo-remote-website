# The Importance of Visual Health Communication Strategies in Research

<div class="method-card">
  <h3>Project Background</h3>
  <p>This was a complex, two-part, 6-week longitudinal remote research study. To increase understanding of study procedures and reduce attrition, research coordinator <strong>Omaya Torres-Grillo</strong> created a series of visuals to help keep participants engaged and informed of the study tasks ahead of them, incorporating participant feedback as part of her MPH capstone project.</p>
</div>

## Areas of Focus

Two areas of participant frustration were specifically targeted:

1. **Setting up participant phones** for location tracking
2. **Answering daily surveys** sent from Lifedata's RealLife Exp app

### Design Principles Applied

The graphics and instructions incorporated:
- Clear language (non-technical words and defined jargon when necessary)
- Non-condescending tone
- Only relevant information (avoiding information overload)

## EMA Survey Schedule Graphics

  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/measures/Capstone_EMA_8AM.jpg' | relative_url }}" 
       alt="Daily survey schedule visualization showing when participants receive EMA prompts"
       style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <p class="image-caption">
    Graphic displaying exactly when participants can expect to receive surveys. Each graphic was tailored to their specific start time (e.g., 6am, 8am, 10am, 12pm), helping participants plan their day around survey prompts and reducing survey burden.
