# Lifedata for EMA: Real-Time Data Collection

<div class="highlight-box">
<p><strong>Ecological Momentary Assessment Platform:</strong> We leveraged Lifedata's Real Life Exp app to collect real-time participant data through randomized surveys, receipt photo uploads, and comprehensive compliance monitoring throughout our longitudinal study.</p>

## üî¨ Why EMA? Scientific Foundation

<div class="resource-card">
<h3>üìö Research-Based Approach</h3>
<p>Our implementation of Ecological Momentary Assessment was grounded in established scientific methodology designed to capture real-world behavior patterns.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
<p>"Assessment in clinical psychology typically relies on global retrospective self-reports collected at research or clinic visits, which are limited by recall bias and are not well suited to address how behavior changes over time and across contexts...EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts."</p>

<h4>Application in Our Study</h4>
<p>EMA methodology enabled participants to regularly record their mood and daily events that could influence their tobacco cravings or cigarette habits. This real-time data collection approach provided several critical advantages:</p>

        <h4>üïí Real-Time Mood Tracking</h4>
        <p>Capture participants' emotional states and experiences as they occurred, eliminating recall bias from retrospective reporting.</p>

    <div class="resource-item">
        <h4>üìç Ecological Validity</h4>
        <p>Ensure data collection occurred in participants' natural environments rather than artificial laboratory settings.</p>

## Platform Overview

**Lifedata** provides a comprehensive mobile-based platform for ecological momentary assessment (EMA) through their Real Life Exp app. This established and professional application enabled our participants to easily engage with our study protocols while providing researchers with powerful tools for data collection and monitoring.

While Lifedata has its limitations, it provided significant freedom in survey development and rollout, while maintaining an intuitive user experience that made it easy for participants to get set up and consistently engage with our study requirements.

## üì± Participant Onboarding with Real Life Exp

<div class="resource-card">
<h3>üöÄ Comprehensive Setup Process</h3>
<p>Our study team developed detailed instructions for both iPhone and Android users to ensure seamless app setup and lifepack configuration. After starting the Qualtrics survey to setup their Lifepak, participants selected the response windows they would be available to answer surveys during. Then they selected their phone type and were given instructions to download the Real Life Exp app and a QR code to download their time-specific lifepack.</p>

<p>Our instructions were very specific and contained step by step instructions and images to walk participants through every step of their setup, followed by a directed practice session given at the start of every study period. Only a few participants needed help from a research assistant, who could easily walk them through downloading their lifepack over the phone.</p>

<h4>Flexible Scheduling Options</h4>
<p>Participants could customize their study experience by choosing from multiple start times to accommodate their personal schedules:</p>

<div class="resource-grid">
    <div class="resource-item">
        <h4>Standard Response Windows</h4>
        <p><strong>Available options:</strong><br>

<h4>Collecting Real-Time Behavioral Data</h4>
<p>Lifedata allowed us to send surveys both at set times and randomly during time-windows. Participants were able to respond to surveys until the time that the next survey was sent. Over the 6-week study period, this let us collect behavioral data at a variety of timepoints throughout the participant's day, giving us insight into their day-to-day behavior</p>
