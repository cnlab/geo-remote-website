# RedCap Integration: Streamlining Research Data Management

<div class="highlight-box">
<p><strong>Comprehensive Data Management:</strong> We leveraged RedCap's powerful features to manage screening data and participant flow throughout our longitudinal study, creating over 90 automated alerts and seamlessly integrating with multiple platforms for efficient research operations.</p>
</div>

## What is RedCap?

**RedCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)** is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases. Originally developed at Vanderbilt University, RedCap provides researchers with an intuitive interface for creating data collection instruments and managing complex research workflows.
